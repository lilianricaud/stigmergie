# Stigmergie Tubuline

A similar stigmergic mechanism was recently recognized in molecular biology
(Tabony, 2006) to explain the self-organization of the microtubules that support many
functions in the cell. These microscopic tubes change shape and move by absorbing
tubulin proteins at one end, and releasing them at the other end. The “trail” of tubulin left
at the shrinking end attracts the growing ends of other microtubules, resulting in the
formation of a coherent “wave” of microtubules moving in the same direction.
