# Money Power: the Institutional Framework

The history of money is intimately entwined with power. Historian Niall Ferguson shows how the modern monetary framework evolved to finance wars through the emergence of four key institutions: 
- **parliaments**, 
- **a professional tax bureaucracy**, 
- **national debt** and, 
- **central banks**. 
 
This “Square of Power” was first optimised in 18th-century Britain to give birth to industrialisation and to a planetary empire. These same monetary arrangements spread around the world to become the fundamental structure in place practically everywhere today.
