# four keystone habits that high-performance groups seem to share:

    Align around success: http://fasterthan20.com/toolkit/goals-success-spectrum/
    Align around working agreements: http://fasterthan20.com/toolkit/working-agreements/
    Assess performance http://fasterthan20.com/2018/11/the-secret-to-a-good-retrospective-actually-having-them/ (i.e. retrospectives http://fasterthan20.com/toolkit/retrospective/)
    Organize and maintain information (i.e. information hygiene)http://fasterthan20.com/wiki/Information_hygiene

The specific manifestation of each practice isnâ€™t that important. What matters most is for groups to do all four of them regularly and well.
