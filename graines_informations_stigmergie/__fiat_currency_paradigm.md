# Fiat Currency Paradigm

The Official Story is that governments, just like any household, must raise the money needed to pay for their activities. This is done either through income by taxation or debt by issuing bonds. In this story, banks simply act as intermediaries collecting deposits and lending parts of that money to creditworthy individuals and institutions, including governments. However, officially since 1971, when fiat currency or money created out of nothing became universal, this story has been a complete fiction. 

The Fiat Currency Paradigm provides an alternative interpretation of this story. 

**With fiat currency, the primary purpose of taxation is to create demand for a currency that has otherwise no intrinsic value. The obligation of paying taxes only in the chosen currency is what gives the currency its value.** A sovereign government can therefore choose what it wants to attribute value to by requiring it in the form of tax payments. Governments can thus determine the kind of efforts its citizens must make to obtain this chosen currency. Although this interpretation has impressive academic backing, it is being ignored in favour of the Official Story. 
In the Official Story, governments are completely powerless in front of an anonymous and all-powerful “financial market.” In the Fiat Currency Paradigm, given the nature of fiat currency, governments could conceivably choose to give value to other currencies in parallel to bank-debt money. We propose that meeting the challenges of the 21st century will require them to do so.
