**Complex Systems Classical science, as exemplified by Newtonian mechanics, is essentially reductionist: it reduces all complex phenomena to their simplest components, and then tries to describe these components in a complete, objective and deterministic manner.** 

**The philosophy of complexity is that this is in general impossible: complex systems, such as organisms, societies, languages, or the Internet, have properties—emergent properties—that cannot be reduced to the mere properties of their parts. Moreover, the behavior of these systems has aspects that are intrinsically unpredictable and uncontrollable, and that cannot be described in any complete manner.**  

While these observations are mostly negative, emphasizing the traditional qualities that complex systems lack, complex systems also have a number of surprisingly positive features, such as adaptivity, autonomy and robustness, that traditional mechanistic systems lack. These qualities can all be seen as aspects of the process of self-organization that typifies complex systems: these systems spontaneously organize themselves so as to better cope with various internal and external problems and perturbations. This allows them to evolve and adapt to a constantly changing environment. Thus, the arrow of time tends to point towards an improved, better organized or more adapted version of the evolving system. 

**This adaptive organization produced by self-organizing evolution can be seen as a form of knowledge or intelligence: the system has become better at solving the problems that confront it; it now “knows” what to do when confronted with a perturbation**

The components of a complex system are commonly called agents. These are individual systems that act upon their environment in response to the events they sense or experience. Typical examples of agents used in complex system models are people, firms, animals, cells, computer programs and molecules.

The spreading of a wave is not a complex phenomenon, though, because its propagation is perfectly regular and predictable, and its intensity diminishes as its reach widens. Processes in complex systems, on the other hand, are usually non-linear: their effects are not proportional to their causes. 

When the effects are larger than the causes, we may say that there is an amplification or positive feedback: initially small perturbations reinforce themselves so as to become ever more intense. An example is the spread of a disease, where a single infection may eventually turn into a global pandemic. (...) When the effects are smaller than the causes, there is a dampening or negative feedback: perturbations are gradually reduced, until the system returns to its equilibrium state.

## Self-organization 

The concept of self-organization is becoming increasingly popular in various branches of science and technology. Although there is no generally accepted definition, a self-organizing system may be characterized by global, coordinated activity arising spontaneously from local interactions between the system's components or “agents”. This activity is distributed over all components, without a central controller supervising or directing the behavior. 

For example, in a school of fish each individual fish bases its behavior on its perception of the position and speed of its immediate neighbors, rather than on the behavior of a “central fish” or that of the whole school. Self-organization establishes a relation between the behavior of the individual components and the structure and functionality of the system as a whole: simple interactions at the local level give rise to complex patterns at the global level. 

This phenomenon is called emergence. 

 An early application of self-organizing mechanisms were neural networks: computer simulations of how the neurons in the brain perform complex tasks (such as learning, classification, and pattern recognition) in a very robust manner without centralized control.

At present, the concept of self-organization has diffused into virtually all scientific disciplines, as an explanation for previously mysterious phenomena in which complex structures arise from the interactions between simpler components.  For example, it has been used in cosmology to explain the emergence of order in the universe; in ecology to understand the evolution of complex ecosystems; in biology to study the coordination between bacteria, cells or individuals in animal collectives, such as ant hills, schools of fish or swarms of birds; in medicine, to explain complex disorders such as epilepsy, heart disease and cancer; in linguistics, to model the origins of lexicons, grammars and phonetic systems; in psychology to explain the emergence of higher level cognitive structures; in sociology and management to compare controlled, top-down organizations with spontaneous, bottom-up communities; in economics to better understand the “invisible hand” that governs the market; in geography, to study cities and regions as self-organizing systems; in robotics as a strategy to get simple agents to tackle complex tasks collaboratively; in philosophy as a foundation for a new evolutionary worldview spanning all levels from matter via life to mind and society. It seems almost as if the concept of self-organization offers a key to unlock a treasure chest of new theories and applications throughout science, doing away with all the rigidities and limitations of the traditional “top-down”, mechanistic approach. In spite of these promises, however, the science of self-organization is still in its infancy. Researchers in different disciplines have studied a variety of examples of self-organization, but they typically take different perspectives and analyze different aspects.    

## Coordination

Coordination can then be defined as: the structuring of actions in time and (social) space so as to minimize friction and maximize synergy between these actions. 

**Coordination can be subdivided in four elementary processes or mechanisms: ALIGNEMENT, DIVISION OF LABOR, WORKFLOW, and AGGREGATION** 

## Self-organization of Alignment 

Alignment is the simplest form of coordination. It means that the different actions (and therefore also their agents) “point in the same direction”, or, more precisely, aim at the same target. Every (intended) action has an implicit goal or target, which is the situation that would be reached if the action would be performed without any perturbation or obstruction throwing it off-course . Imagine two individuals simultaneously pushing against a heavy object to get it out of the way. If the one pushes to the left (direction or target of the push), and the other to the right, their actions will oppose and thus obstruct each other. Assuming that the forces with which they push are equal, the result is that the object will not move at all, even though both agents may spend all of their energy pushing it. This is an extreme example of friction caused by a complete lack of alignment. Friction does not in general imply conflict between the agents, though. Perhaps the two individuals really want to reach the same overall goal, such as getting the obstacle off the road. However, because their actions are not coordinated, they effectively oppose each other. To minimize friction, they should somehow come to push in the same direction, i.e. align their actions. Alignment is in general easy to achieve by self-organization. Assume that the two agents cannot see each other, so that they have no idea a priori of what the other is doing. Still, when pushing in opposite directions they will feel that their movement is blocked. Therefore, their natural reaction will be to try and push in a different direction. If the new push is not opposed by the other’s push, the obstacle will move, and the agents will continue to push in that direction. With a little bit of trial-and-error they may further discover that by pushing in one precise direction, their push is not only not hindered, but actually fully reinforced by the other – 5 –one who is pushing in the same direction. Once they discover this shared direction, their actions are fully aligned, and their effort is maximally productive. Therefore, each of them will continue to push in that direction, even without knowing that the other one is doing the same. This example illustrates the mechanism of self-organization at the most elementary level. An action that is not succesful will normally be varied (variation). On the other hand, an action that is successful will be maintained or reinforced (*selective retention* or *multiplication*).  

**Successful actions are characterized by minimal friction and maximal synergy.**   

## Division of Labor 

Alignment of agents and their actions is a first requirement for them to work in a coordinated, organized manner. However, if all agents merely act in the same way, their combined action will be at most quantitatively more powerful than their individual action. For example, ten agents can push a weight that is ten times as heavy than the weight pushed by a single agent. But you cannot build a house using only agents that lay bricks; you will also need the expertise to dig foundations, do carpentry, lay electricity, install plumbing, paint, etc. To reap the full benefits of cooperation, different actions need to complement each other. Only then can the activity as a whole achieve more than the sum of its parts. This assumes that different agents perform different tasks, each specializing in what it does best. Since each agent is limited in its abilities, the one may compensate for what the otherone lacks so that together they can solve a problem that requires a diverse array of skills. But the problem then becomes one of the division of labor: who does what? Assuming that there is a variety of different tasks to be done, and a variety of skills distributed among the different agents, so that each agent is skilled at different tasks to different degrees, the coordination problem becomes one of optimally matching each individual with each task. At first sight, this requires a supervisor having an extensive knowledge both of the necessary tasks and of the individuals’ degree of skills, and the intelligence necessary to conceive of all the different possible permutations of agent-task assignments and to select the best one. Yet, the problem allows for a simple, self-organizing solution. Assume that agents prefer to do the tasks they are most skilled at, because those are the ones that will cost them least effort. In that case, it suffices for the different tasks to be laid out in such a way that all available agents can examine them. As soon as an agent recognizes a task that it is particularly skilled at, it will pick up that task, leaving less fitting tasks for the others. Thus, the number of remaining tasks will gradually diminish. There is of course the risk that the remaining tasks fit none of the remaining agents, but we can make the assumption that all agents are flexible to some degree and can if necessary do a task they are not particularly skilled at, albeit less efficiently. In this way, the different tasks will get performed in an overall rather efficient way, although the arrangement may not be optimal. (Such less-than-optimal, but more-than- acceptable performance is what we normally find in the real world, as opposed to the idealized world of mathematical models, where things tend to work either perfectly, or not at all...).   

## Workflow 
Division of labor coordinates activities that happen simultaneously—in parallel. Workflow [van der Aalst & van Hee, 2004] is its complement: it coordinates activities that take place the one after the other—sequentially. The name derives from the image of an unfinished piece of work “flowing” from one worker to the next, as if carrried by a conveyor belt in a factory assembly line. In general, a complex activity, such as building a house, happens in subsequent stages, and the later stages (such as painting the walls) cannot be performed before the earlier ones (such as building a roof and plastering the walls) have been finished. Planning and scheduling such a branching sequence of mutually dependent activities may seem to require an intelligent and knowledgeable supervisor, supported perhaps by specialized management tools, such as Gantt charts or PERT networks. Again, self-organizing solutions to the problem exist that function quite effectively. The mechanism is similar to the one underlying the division of labor. An agent that has finished the task it initially selected will normally look around for other tasks that might fit its profile. If one of those tasks becomes available, e.g. because another agent just finished executing that part of an activity it felt competent at, but stopped when it no longer felt able to continue, the first agent will pick up the work where the other one left off. For example, a brick layer may leave a wall as soon as all the bricks are in place, and thus make room for a plasterer to cover and smoothen the rough brick surface. When the plaster covering has dried, a painter may then finish the work by coating the wall with paint.  

## Aggregation 

To fully reap the benefits of synergetic action, we need a final mechanism of coordination: aggregation. Different agents contributing different actions at different times to a joint activity will be most effective when the fruits of their activity are assembled into a final product. This process of collecting all the contributions and synthesizing them into a coherent outcome may be called “aggregation”. Like division of labor, aggregation is a parallel process: different streams of activity come together simultaneously. However, while division of labor is a branching process, where an activity is split up into smaller, independently executed tasks, aggregation goes the other way, letting the branches converge again into a single result. Division of labor, workflow and aggregation can be seen as the three fundamental aspects or dimensions of a complex, branching network of mutually dependent processes. Aggregation too allows for self-organizing approaches. The simplest one is when the different actions superimpose their results on a shared substrate or medium.  ## Collective intelligence  Solving abstract problems requires intelligence. When this intelligence is localized in a single agent, it may be called individual intelligence. When it is distributed over a group of agents, it may be called collective intelligence: it is only the group as a whole that is capable of solving certain problems [Heylighen, 1999]. Collective intelligence assumes that different agents have different forms of expertise (knowledge, information, skills). Otherwise, they would not be able to do more together than individually. Achieving collective intelligence therefore is a problem of cognitive coordination between the different agents. This can again be split up into the four basic mechanisms of alignment, division of labor, workflow and aggregation   After discussing many examples of successful and less successful cognitive coordination, Surowiecki proposes the following list of requirements that a group must fulfil to exhibit collective intelligence (or wisdom of crowds, as he calls it): • Diversity: the more diverse the knowledge and experience possessed by the different members of the group, the more the group as whole knows and the less its members are likely to overlook certain aspects, or to fall prey to the same bias. • Independence: individuals should express their contribution as much as possible independently from other members of the group; otherwise, when the opinion of the one is influenced by the opinion of the other, there is a risk of premature alignment, i.e. between the contributions themselves rather than between the targets of the contributions. • Decentralization: this Surowiecky’s term for what we have called “division of labor”: people should as much as possible be able to gather and process their information in parallel, so that they can together cover an as wide range of aspects as possible. • Aggregation: collective intelligence requires an effective mechanism, such as voting, averaging or discussion, for synthesizing a diversity of individual opinions into a single, collective answer (wisdom of crowds)    

## conclusion  

This paper has reviewed the mechanism of self-organization, conceived as the spontaneous coordination of actions performed by different agents. Such coordination helps to make the actions more synergetic, while reducing the friction between them. The result is that coordinated actions achieve their intended goals more easily and more effectively. In particular, coordination may result in an apparently unreachable goal or unsolvable problem getting within reach, as sources of obstruction vanish and missing elements are fitted in. The underlying dynamic of self-organization is local trial-and-error or variation-and-selection, in which two interacting agents try to mutually adapt their actions, until they hit on a “coordinated” pattern that is acceptable to both, and thus is selectively retained. This local pattern is then typically propagated step-by-step to the neighboring agents and the neighbors’ neighbors. The spreading “wave” of coordination is thus amplified until it encompasses the global system, via a process of positive feedback. Coordination can be decomposed into four relatively independent mechanisms: alignment, division of labor, workflow and aggregation. Alignment is the simplest, as it merely requires the agents to “point in the same direction”, i.e. direct their actions at the same targets. This is necessary to avoid the friction that is otherwise caused by opposing actions. Alignment creates convergence or homogeneity between interacting agents. When the agents are distributed across space, the resulting homogeneity may be limited to a certain region, with boundaries between differently aligned regions emerging after self-organization. This can explain the appearance of separate cultures or languages, and the points of friction between them. Even when such remaining friction is avoided, alignment is not yet sufficient to reap the full benefits of synergy, in which the whole of the actions produces more than the sum of the effects produced by each action separately. Synergy requires complementarity, in which one action makes up for what the other one lacks, so that together they can achieve goals that they cannot achieve alone. Synergy is promoted by the other three coordination mechanism. Division of labor means that different agents perform different actions at the same time, so that each can contribute its unique expertise to the part of problem it is most skilled at. Workflow means that an action is followed by a subsequent action that fills in the gaps left by the previous one. Aggregation, finally, ensures that all these different contributions are assembled into a coherent outcome. These mechanism have been defined at the most general, abstract level, so that they can in principle be applied to any complex system. Indeed, all systems and their components can be conceptualized as agents, i.e. entities that act in response to sensed conditions, and this with apparent “intentionality”—meaning that these actions are directed at a particular target or goal. However, the present paper has focused on applications in social systems, where groups of human individuals communicate with each other.  

**The first issue here is the emergence of collective intentionality: how do groups align the targets of their communications and actions?** (...)

 **A second issue is the emergence of collective intelligence: in how far do people manage to solve problems better as a group than individually?**(...)   In conclusion, self-organization in communicating groups is a fascinating topic that can throw a new light on a variety of fundamental problems, including the origin of language and communication, how best to achieve coordination between agents and their actions, and how to maximize the intelligence of collectives. Both the conceptual framework and the methods for experimentation and simulation appear sufficiently developed to enable quick further progress. I therefore hope this paper will encourage other researchers to further investigate these issues
