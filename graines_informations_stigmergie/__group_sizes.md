# Group sizes  

## Elliot, M.
Research has shown that the ideal size for collaborating groups (where technology is not being used in any way) is 2-8, with an upper limit of around 25 (Lipnack & Stamps 180-1).

It can be easily observed in any organization that working groups larger than seven people fragment into two smaller groups. There are several theories as to why this happens, but the prevailing theory has to do with the amount of effort we need to spend upholding and caring for relationships within a working group. Let’s illustrate with an example. In a group of two people, there is just one relationship that the group needs to care for. In a group of three people, there are three relationships (A to B, B to C, and A to C). In a group of five, there are suddenly 4+3+2+1 = ten relationships. And if we up the group size to the critical seven people, there are twenty-one relationships between people that the group needs to maintain in order to function as a working group. As we can see in this math, the social complexity of the group increases much faster than the group size. At some point, the group becomes inefficient, having to spend so much effort just on coher- ing the group that it gets very little or no actual work done. When we add an eighth member to a group, the number of rela- tionships to maintain climbs from twenty-one to twenty-eight. So while adding an eighth member to the group adds 14 percent work capacity to the group compared to seven people, it also requires the group to spend 33 percent more of their combined work capacity on the task of maintaining the group itself, on maintaining twenty- eight relationships instead of twenty-one. At this point, or some- times at a ninth member, the group falls apart. What we learn from this is that the scaffolding needs to be con- structed so that no more than seven people work closely with one another in a given tight context.

So the smallest of the three magic social group sizes is seven.
The largest is 150.
There is no relationship between these numbers. The number seven
appears to come from a practical limit to the effort spent on maintaining a group, as previously explained. The more elusive number 150 appears to be a limit hardwired into our brains.

The number 150 appears in tons of places through human organiza-
tional history. It is our maximum tribe size. In a given context, we have the capacity to know this many people by name and have the loosest of bonds with them.

Anthropologists, looking at the size of the neocortex in our brain and comparing it to those of other primates and their tribe sizes, tend to regard this number as a biological limit.
This limit is also known as Dunbar’s Number, or the Dunbar Limit,
from British anthropologist Robin Dunbar, who first wrote about it.

If you are working at a company which has fewer than 150
employees, odds are that you know them all by name — or at least
you have the capacity to do so. Beyond that size, you start referring to anonymous people by their function rather than referring to people you know by their name. You’ll go see “somebody in Support,” rather than “having a talk with Maria or Dave.” The most successful companies, organizations, and cultures are keenly aware of this human limit. To take the Amish as one example, as their settlements approach 150 in size, they split the settlement into two. The company Gore and Associates — more known as the makers of the Gore-Tex fabric — never puts more than 150 employees in a single plant. There are many more examples.
The effect on building your organization is the same as in every
other successful organization: you need to know that groups above
150 people in size will lose the social bonding required for efficiency and, well, the fun.

Finally, the third magic group size is thirty. This is a group which falls between our tight working group and those we know by name, but not much more: we are capable of knowing more than just their names in the group of thirty, we know a couple of interests and curious facts about the others in this group, but we can’t work tightly with all of them. It can be thought of as an extended family.

if (a) group coordinating all the aspects of (a) work (...) starts approaching thirty-five people, then that group is blocking further growth of the swarm and should be divided into two, allowing for more growth (...).
