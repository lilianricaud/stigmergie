# Bazar vs cathedral

The paradox of the open access community is that it seems to ignore most of these organizational principles as well. In general, anyone can join or leave a given community at any moment, and there are no formal members or employees, as different people tend to be involved to different degrees.

Moreover, the community is typically decentralized, without formal, hierarchical structure or punishments for free riders. Raymond (1999) has called this loose, self-organizing cooperation model a “bazaar”, as contrasted with the “cathedral” model that exemplifies closed, centralized, hierarchical organizations.
