# Rules for self-organization

These rules basically govern how, where, and what the system can add onto or substract from itself under what conditions. As hundreds of computer models have demonstrated, **complex and delightful patterns can evolve from quite simple sets of rules.**

The genetic code within the DNA that is the basis of all biological evolution contains just four different letters, coimbined into words of three letters each. that pattern, and the rules for replicating and rearranging it, has been constant for something like three billions years during which it spewed out an unimaginable variety of failed and successful self-evolved creatures.

**Self-organization is basically a matter of an evolutionnary raw material - a highly variable stock of information from which to select possible patterns - and a mean for experimentation, for selecting and testing new patterns.**

when you understand the power of system self-organization, you begin to understand why biologist worship biodiversity even more than econonomiste worship technology. the wildly varied stock of DNA, evolved and accumulated over billions of years, is the source of EVOLUTIONNARY POTENTIAL, just as science libraries and labs and universities where scientists are trained are the source of technological potential. Allowing species to go exctinct is a systems crime, just as ramdomly eliminating all copies of a particular science journals or particular kinds of scientists would be. that could be said of human cultures, of course, which are the store of behavioral repertoires, accumulated over not billions, but hundreds of thousands of years.
