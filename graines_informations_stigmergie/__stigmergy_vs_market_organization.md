# stigmergy vs market organization  

## Essential

Since the fall of the Soviet Union, the common assumption has been that markets, private property rights, and commercial organizations are necessary to efficiently produce and distribute products. In addition to the apparent failure of communism, this view has been supported by two centuries of economic thought developing sophisticated models that purport to show that the market is the optimal way to allocate resources. In the last few years, however, the collective development of “open access” information products on the Web has emerged like a salient exception
to this conventional wisdom.

In open source communities, distributed coordination cannot rely on the market mechanism either, since there are no prices for products to signal where demand is greatest.

basic economic assumptions of rivalry and excludability are not applicable to information shared over the Internet. Once created, information is
intrinsically not a scarce good, and therefore there is no a priori reason to restrict access to it. On the contrary, freely distributing information is likely to profit its creator, since it helps to improve the quality of the information, and to enhance the creator’s expertise and reputation.

the paradigm of self-organization through stigmergy is used by authors (Heylighen, Elliot) to explain how open access development can be efficiently coordinated.

Thanks to shared workspace listing “work-in-progress”, people willing to contribute to the collective development of an information product are efficiently directed to the tasks where their contribution is most likely to be fruitful. This obviates the need both for centralized planning and
control, and for the “invisible hand” of the market matching supply to demand.

Stigmergic prioritization is arguably even more efficient than a market, since there is no need for the complex and often irrational processes of buying, selling, bargaining and speculation that determine the eventual price of a commodity—leading to the typically chaotic movements of commodity prices on the stock exchange.** 

Moreover, **although price could be interpreted as a— very abstract—stigmergic signal, this variable is merely one-dimensional**. On the other hand, **open access tasks could be ranked on a website according to independent stigmergic criteria**

### Market-based systems  

Institutional economics adds a qualification to the power of market mechanisms, though. Its main assumption is that individuals competing in a market will start to formally cooperate, thus forming an organization or firm, in order to reduce transaction costs (Williamson & Maste, 1995).

Transaction costs arise because of the need to negotiate and arrange any exchange of goods, services or money. These negotiations cost a lot of effort and time, while failing to fully eliminate basic uncertainties (is this product or service reliable? are there loopholes in the contract?). 

A firm is based on a set of agreed-upon rules governing the interactions between its employees, so as to minimize negotiations and uncertainties. This requires drawing a clear boundary between those who belong to the organization (and therefore are expected to obey the rules) and those who do not. That also helps to ensure that no private information is leaked out of the group, where it could be exploited by competitors. Whereas regulations may be more reliable than a free market, they are less flexible: they cannot adapt automatically to new circumstances. Therefore, the organization requires a form of intelligent management to coordinate the activities of the employees, and direct them to the most important task at hand. This is normally achieved by means of a hierarchical structure, with a CEO or board of directors at the top, to plan and control the activity and issue commands down the line to the lower levels. This control system moreover must ensure that the employees play according to the rules, and do not selfishly exploit the opportunities without giving their due effort in return. In other words, the management must thwart the ever-present danger of “free riders” by implementing effective punishment when necessary.

The paradox of the open access community is that it seems to ignore most of these organizational principles as well. In general, anyone can join or leave a given community at any moment, and there are no formal members or employees, as different people tend to be involved to different degrees. Moreover, the community is typically decentralized, without formal, hierarchical structure or punishments for free riders. Raymond (1999) has called this loose, self-organizing cooperation model a “bazaar”, as contrasted with the “cathedral” model that exemplifies closed, centralized, hierarchical organizations. Yet, this distributed coordination cannot rely on the market mechanism either, since there are no prices for products to signal where demand is greatest.
In conclusion, open access development not only contravenes common business
wisdom, but some of the most fundamental assumptions of economic theory. This means that we need to develop an alternative theory to explain how open access can function.

Rather than having a central committee decide which entries are most important, Wikipedia implements a simple form of collective decision-making (cf. Heylighen, 1999): the entries that have most hyperlinks pointing to them are listed first in an automatically generated list of “most wanted articles”.

Such a mechanism to display collective demand can be seen as the non-proprietary analog of the market. The price mechanism efficiently allocates resources to the production of those goods for which demand is highest, by offering the highest monetary rewards for them. 

Similarly, a “most wanted” ordering of requests offers the highest probability of recognition for the work performed, or of “good feelings”
engendered by an altruistic deed. 

**Such stigmergic prioritization is arguably even more efficient than a market, since there is no need for the complex and often irrational processes of buying, selling, bargaining and speculation that determine the eventual price of a commodity—leading to the typically chaotic movements of commodity prices on the stock exchange.** 

Moreover, **although price could be interpreted as a— very abstract—stigmergic signal, this variable is merely one-dimensional**. On the other hand, **open access tasks could be ranked on a website according to independent stigmergic criteria**, such as urgency, difficulty, expected utility, required expertise, etc. In that way, potential contributors would be helped in finding the task that suits them best
