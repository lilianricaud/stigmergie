# system's definition

A system isn'tjust any old colelction of things. **A system is an interconnected set of elements that is coherently organized in a way that achieves something.**

A systems consists of three kinds of things:
- elements
- interconnections
- and a function or purpose

**The least obvious part of the system, its function is often the most crucial determinant of the system's behavior.**

The elements, the parts of the systems we are most likely to notice, are often (not always) least important in defining the unique characteristics of the system - *unless changing and element also results in changing relationships or purpose.*

the word function is generaly used for nonhuman system, the word purpose for a human one, but the distinction is not absolute, since so many systems have both human and non-human elements.

A system is more than the sum of its parts. It may exhibit adaptive, dynamic, goal-seeking, self-preserving, and sometimes evolutionnary behavior.

Many of the interconnections in systems operate through the flow of information. Information holds systems together and plays a great role in determining how they operate.

## How to know if you are looking at a system or just a bunch of stuff:
- Can you identify parts ? ... and
- Do the parts affect each other ? ... and 
- Do the parts together produce an effect that is different from the effect of each part on its own ? ... and perhaps
- Does the effect, the behavio over time, persist in a variety of circumstances ?

## Examples

Sand scattered on a road by happenstance is not, itself, a system. 
When a living creature dies, it loses its "system-ness". The multiple interrelations that held it together no longer function, and it dissipates, although its material remains part of a larger food-web system.

A school is a system. so is a city, and a factory, and a coroporation, and a national economy

An animal is a system. a tree is a system, and a forest is a larger system that encompasses subsystems of trees and animals. The earth is a system. so is the solar system. so is a galaxy.

**systems can be embedded in systems, which are embedded in yet other systems.**
**systems can be nested within systems, therefore there can be purposes withinh purposes.**




Digestive system
- elements: teeth, enzymes, stomach, intestines, ...
- interconnections: physical flow of food, elegant set of regulating chemical signals
- function: break food into its basic nutrients and transfer those nutrients into the blood stream (another system) while discarding unusable wastes.

Footbal team
- elements: players, coach, field and ball
- interconnections: rules of the game, coach strategy, player's communications, law of physics that govern the motions of ball and players
- purpose: win games, or have fun, or get exercise, or make millions or all of the above.
