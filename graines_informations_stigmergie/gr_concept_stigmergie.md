Le concept de stigmergie a été proposé par l'entomologiste français Pierre-Paul Grasse ́ (Grasse ́, 1959) pour décrire le mécanisme de coordination utilisé par les insectes. Le principe est que le travail effectué par un agent laisse une traces dans l'environnement qui stimule l'accomplissement de nouveaux travaux par le même ou d'autres agents. La médiation par l'environnement assure que les taches sont exécutés dans l'ordre correct, sans besoin de planification, de contrôle ou d'interaction directe entre les agents


The concept of stigmergy was proposed by the French
entomologist Pierre-Paul Grasse ́ (Grasse ́, 1959) to describe
a mechanism of coordination used by insects. The principle
is that work performed by an agent leaves a trace in the
environment that stimulates the performance of subsequent
work—by the same or other agents. This mediation via the
environment ensures that tasks are executed in the right
order, without any need for planning, control, or direct
interaction between the agents. The notion of stigmergy
allowed Grasse ́ to solve the ‘‘coordination paradox’’
(Theraulaz & Bonabeau, 1999), i.e. the question of how
insects of very limited intelligence, without apparent com-
munication, manage to collaboratively tackle complex pro-
jects, such as building a nest.


The insight came from Grasse ́’s observation of how ter-
mites repair their nest. He noted that initially termites wan-
der around more or less randomly, carrying mud and
depositing it here or there. However, the deposits that are
created in this haphazard way then stimulate the insects
to add more mud in the same place. Thus, the small heaps
quickly grow into columns that eventually come together
to form an intricate cathedral of interlocking arches. The
only communication between the termites is indirect: the
partially executed work of the ones provides information
to the others about where to make their own contribution.
Another classic example of stigmergy can be found in
the pheromone trails left by ants that come back from a
food source (Sumpter & Beekman, 2003). The pheromone
stimulates other ants to follow the same path. When they
find food, they too will reinforce the pheromone trail while
following the trail back to the nest. This mechanism
leads to the emergence of an efficient network of trails
