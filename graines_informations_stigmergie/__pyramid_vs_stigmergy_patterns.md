## Pyramid patterns

closed, centralized, hierarchical organizations.
strict control from leaders.

partial excludability is a threat
scarcity

coordination of collaboration occurs primarily through direct communication and social negociation

precise planning
work is typically performed in a highly organized and controlled way
information about the present state of the project is hidden.

## stigmergic patterns

anyone can join or leave a given community at any moment
no formal members or employee
the community is typically decentralized, without formal, hierarchical structure or punishments for free riders.
abundance
coordination of collaboration occurs primarily through indirect communication, social negociation is optionnal.

self-reinforcing or autocatalytic process, positive feedback cycle

few central figures (such as Linus Torvalds, Jimmy Wales, Rick Falvinge) that determine the general direction in which the project is headed, this control is much less strict than in traditional hierarchical organizations.

lack of precise planning
work is typically performed in a distributed, self-organizing way.
information about the present state of the project is completely and freely
available

contributors select the tasks they work on themselves,

profits from the evolutionary dynamic of variation, recombination and selection

Openness attracts a greater number and diversity of participants,
increasing the likeliness of cross-fertilization of their ideas into new combinations.
This strongly accelerates the variation that is necessary to produce evolutionary novelty.

This large and diverse community moreover enhances selection, since the
new ideas will be tested in many more different circumstances, thus systematically eliminating the errors and weaknesses that might not have shown in a more homogeneous environment. All in all, this leads to greater flexibility, innovation, and reliability.

the visible traces of the work performed previously function as a mediator system


No need for previous planning: agents only need to know the present state of the activity in the shared medium; neither previous nor subsequent steps matters to complete the present individual task;
b) No need for agent long-term memory: all useful information is already available in the same medium, at any moment;
c) No need for direct communication: information exchange among the agents is indirect (mediated by the same work) and there’s no need for negotiation either;
d) No need for mutual awareness: each agent works by himself, independently from the others; he has no need to know if other agents influence his work, nor how they do it;
e) Stigmergic dynamics are asynchronic, so it doesn’t require a simultaneous activity of the agents: the task keep recorded in the same medium, therefore another agent can replace the former one also if they have no direct relation at all;
f) No compromise are needed: each agent decides only at that very moment to contribute or not;
g) No need for centralized control, because system activity is self-organised in cybernetic dynamics.
