# Making Economic Paradigms Explicit

**Debates around economic issues rarely reveal the paradigm from which an economist speaks.**

We start by making explicit the conceptual framework that underlies our approach, and compare it with other paradigms currently in use. Rather than defining environmental and social issues as “externalities,” our approach sees economic activities as a subset of the social realm, which in turn, is a subset of the biosphere. 

We suffer from a three-layered collective “blind spot” with regards to our monetary system.

The first blind spot relates to **patriarchal societies, which have historically imposed as a monopoly, a single centrally issued currency, on which interest is being charged.** In contrast, matrifocal societies, such as the ones in Dynastic Egypt and the Central Middle Ages in Europe, have encouraged multiple parallel currencies. This has resulted in greater economic stability, equitable prosperity and an economy in which people naturally tend to consider the longer term more than we do.

The second layer of our collective “blind spot” is a result of the ideological warfare between capitalism and communism in the 20th century. Although minute differences between these two systems have been studied ad nauseam, what **they have in common has remained less scrutinized, particularly the fact that both impose a single national currency monopoly created through bank debt.** The only significant difference between the two is that, in the Soviet system, the state owned the banks, whereas in the capitalist system, this occurs only periodically, such as after banks “too big to fail” experience serious difficulties.

From the 18th century onwards, **the systemic status quo was institutionalised through the creation of central banks as enforcers of the monetary monopoly**. This institutional framework spins the final layer of the “blind spot.” 

These three layers explain why there is such powerful and enduring resistance to reconsidering the **paradigm of a single, monopolistically produced currency.**
