# Direct vs indirect stigmergy  

To better understand the methods used by open access communities, we need to further distinguish direct from indirect stigmergy. 

**In direct stigmergy, as exemplified by the termite-hill building, it is the “work-in-progress” itself that directs subsequent contributions.** 

**Indirect stigmergy may be exemplified by the way ants create trails of pheromones that direct other ants to food sources. The trails are left as “side-effects” of the actual work being performed: finding and bringing food to the nest.** 

Such specially created traces may be needed because the task—finding the proverbial “needle (food) in the haystack (surroundings)”—is too complex to be performed.  without detailed clues. Thus, “indirect stigmergy” uses an additional medium for information storage. 

Yet, the coordination achieved in this way still keeps the hallmarks of distributed self-organization: the information is addressed to no one in particular, and may or may not be picked up by a particular individual at a particular moment. In open access development, indirect stigmergy can be recognized in forums where bugs or feature requests are posted. 

These forums are themselves not part of the information product being developed, but they are regularly consulted by the developers, thus attracting their attention to tasks that seem worth performing. 

The problem with such an additional medium is that it adds to the complexity of the (self- )organization, especially if there is a lot of potentially relevant information posted there so that it becomes difficult to establish priorities. 

Here again we can learn a lesson from social insects. The pheromone trails left by ants undergo an efficient form of reinforcement learning (Heylighen, 1999): trails that lead to rich food sources will be used by many ants and thus amplified, trails that lead to poor or empty sources will weaken and eventually disappear. Since ants preferentially follow strong trails, this mechanism ensures that the most important tasks or opportunities are tackled first. 

Applied to open access development, this means that we need adaptive mechanisms to make the most important requests stand out. An example of such mechanism can be found in Wikipedia. When a contributor marks a word as a hyperlink, but there is no article discussing this concept yet, an empty page is created inviting other contributors to fill in its content. 

This is direct stigmergy: whenever people look for that concept, they are directed immediately to the work that still needs to be done. But when there are many thousands of as yet incomplete entries, priorities must be established. 

Rather than having a central committee decide which entries are most important, Wikipedia implements a simple form of collective decision-making (cf. Heylighen, 1999): the entries that have most hyperlinks pointing to them are listed first in an automatically generated list of “most wanted articles”.
