# Stigmergie définition

## Histoire

Grassé: 
The term “stigmergy” was derived by Grassé from the Greek roots, stigma, which means
“mark or puncture” (typically referring to the tattoo used to mark slaves), and ergon
which can mean “work, action, or the product of work”. Grassé motivated this derivation
by interpreting stigma as a goad, prod or spur, i.e. a stinging movement (“piqure” in the
original French text) that incites activity. Ergon is then the result of previous work
responsible for this stimulus or incitement. Thus, (Grassé, 1959) defined stigmergy as
“the stimulation of workers by the very performances they have achieved” (from the
original English abstract).

Parunak, (2006) proposes a different reading of the Greek etymology that is at least as compelling: 

if we interpret stigma as “mark” or “sign” and ergon as “action”, then stigmergy is “the notion that an agent’s actions leave signs in the environment, signs that it and other agents sense and that
determine their subsequent actions”. Summarizing, in Grassé’s interpretation the product
of work (ergon) functions as a stimulus (stigma) for action; in Parunak’s interpretation,
action (ergon) leaves a mark (stigma). While this double interpretation may seem to add
to the confusion, it actually provides an elegant illustration of the bidirectional nature of
stigmergy. The process described by both Grassé and Parunak is a feedback loop, where
an action produces a mark which in turn incites an action, which produces another mark,
and so on (see Fig. 1). In other words, actions stimulate their own continued execution
via the intermediary of the marks they make—where a mark is a perceivable effect, trace
or product of an action.

Heylighen definition:
stigmergy is an indirect, mediated mechanism of coordination between actions, in which the trace of an action left on a medium stimulates the performance of a subsequent action.
