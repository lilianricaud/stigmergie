# Stigmergie chez les termites

## L'histoire

Le biologiste Grassé a inventé la notion de stigmergie en observant la façon dont les termites reparaient leur nid.

Il a noté que initiallement les termites se déplaçaient de manière plus ou moins aléatoire, portant de la boue et la déposant ici ou la. 


The insight came from Grasse ́’s observation of how termites repair their nest. He noted that initially termites wan-
der around more or less randomly, carrying mud and
depositing it here or there. However, the deposits that are
created in this haphazard way then stimulate the insects
to add more mud in the same place. Thus, the small heaps
quickly grow into columns that eventually come together
to form an intricate cathedral of interlocking arches. The
only communication between the termites is indirect: the
partially executed work of the ones provides information
to the others about where to make their own contribution.
Another classic example of stigmergy can be found in
the pheromone trails left by ants that come back from a
food source (Sumpter & Beekman, 2003). The pheromone
stimulates other ants to follow the same path. When they
find food, they too will reinforce the pheromone trail while
following the trail back to the nest. This mechanism
leads to the emergence of an efficient network of trails
