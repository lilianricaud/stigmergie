# Principles and ideas from Swarmise

Your idea needs to be tangible, credible,
inclusive, and epic.
The organization consists only of
relationships between people.
THE THREE MAGIC GROUP SIZES
When the swarm hits 150 people, you must
start breaking it up into smaller groups

A swarm optimizes for speed, trust, and scalability.
do not be affraid of empty boxes in the org chart
if you're not taking care of yourself, you're not taking care of the swarm

## Control the Vision, but Never the Message
enforce the principle of "if you see something you don't like, contribute with someting you do like."

## Keep Everybody’s Eyes on Target, and Paint It Red Daily
- Accountability and authority must always go hand in hand as they are delegated.
- Make all the targets visible and show the progress toward them.
- Anything you measure in public will get improved. Make sure it’s the right thing.
- SETTING VISIBLE, ACTIVATING, AND INCLUSIVE GOALS
Meetings as heartbeat

The swarm must have mechanisms for conflict resolution, for decision making, and for reward culture. There are many ways to accomplish this. A traditional voting democracy is one of the worst.

MERITOCRACY AND THE LAW OF TWO FEET
- An organization is people, and attention is reward.

BROADCASTING AND MAINTAINING VALUES

Having fun in the swarm is crucial to
growing the activist base

GROWING ON THE EDGES
Attention is reward. Unexpected attention
is great reward.
