# Collective information processing

The above-described self-organization mechanisms constitute a powerful means by which
a large number of individuals can achieve specific tasks that are often beyond the single in-
dividual’s abilities, particularly when talking about animals. Although each group member
acquires and spreads information locally, and this information is often limited and unre-
liable, the system as a whole fulfills higher-level tasks as if it had a global knowledge of
the environment (Bonabeau et al., 1999). Among the cases described before, three kinds of
collective outcomes can be identified : sorting, optimization and consensus formation.


## Sorting : 
The dynamics underlying the website digg.com constitutes a typical example
of a self-organized sorting procedure. The more relevant a story, the more often it is ‘digged’.
Therefore, the number of diggs a story gets attests for its rank at a given moment of time. The
website thus acts as an information sorting system. The sorting is dynamic : the relevance
of a given story is a subjective feature that depends on the users’ interests, who choose to
digg it or not. Consequently, according to the system’s sensitivity to individual behaviors,
the emerging classification of the stories is likely to vary between different communities,
with respect to their cultural background, interests or goals. Various other self-organized
systems generate such sorting of elements present in the environment. In some species of
ants, for example, eggs are sorted out by workers according to their developmental stage
and grouped into heaps of the same category. In this system, a positive feedback loop arises
from the tendency of ants to deposit the egg they carry closer to a heap of elements of the
same size (Deneubourg et al., 1990). In human populations, the segregation of people of
different origins, social class or opinions follows a similar kind of non-linear dynamics and
exhibits the main characteristics of a self-organized process (Schelling, 1969). In that case,
the “sorting” process acts on the involved individuals themselves rather than on external
elements of the environment.

## Reaching consensus : 

Self-organized processes can also cause a group to reach a consensus. Achieving consensus on a given behavior is an essential aspect of collective organization,
since it allows the individuals to act cohesively and prevents the group from splitting. Moreover, in most cases the consensus points toward the best alternative, which is often referred
as “the wisdom of crowds” and based on an efficient collective integration of information
(Surowiecki, 2004). In the case of foraging ants, the mechanisms underlying the recruitment
of new workers leads the colony to choose among foraging strategies of different profitabi-
lity. The presence of several alternatives (e.g. several food sources or several paths toward
a given food source) systematically results in a common decision about which option the
colony will concentrate its activity on. The solution that is amplified faster is usually chosen
at the expense of the others. In particular, if a given solution provides a higher benefit to
the colony (e.g. a richer food source), signal modulation favors information related to this
option, and the entire colony finally focuses on it. Similarly, the large number of fish that
constitutes a school reaches a collective consensus on the swimming direction. In particu-
lar, models show that the larger a school, the more it will be receptive to the information
provided by a small percentage of informed individuals, which finally induce the schools to
move toward a relevant destination (Couzin et al., 2005). The emergence of synchronized
applause in an audience is another illustration, where numerous people achieve a consensus
on their clapping rhythm.
Optimization : Finally, the third collective task highlighted by the case studies is the
optimization of the group’s activities. The formation of lanes in the bidirectional movements
of ants and pedestrians is a form of traffic optimization. In both systems, repeated encounters
with other individuals moving in the opposite direction constitute a serious disturbance of
efficient and collective motion. The organization into lanes reduces the interaction frequency
and the number of necessary braking or avoidance maneuvers. In such a way, the traffic ef-
ficiency is optimized. In humans, the additional emergence of walking conventions, such as
a common preferred side of avoidance, further enhances the efficiency of traffic (Helbing,
1991). Likewise, the occurrence of trail systems allows pedestrians to optimize their travel
from one point to another by finding a compromise that minimizes detours while maximizing
the comfort of walking.
