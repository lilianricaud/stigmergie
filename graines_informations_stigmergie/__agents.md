# Agents

The components of a complex system are commonly called agents. These are individual systems that act upon their environment in response to the events they sense or experience. 

Typical examples of agents used in complex system models are people, firms, animals, cells, computer programs and molecules. 

Usually, agents are assumed to be goal-directed: their actions aim to maximize their individual “fitness”, “utility” or “preference”. 

In that sense, their actions can be seen as intentional [Heylighen, 2011] they are performed so as to achieve a particular purpose or objective.

When no explicit goal can be distinguished, their activity still follows a simple cause-and-effect or condition-action logic: an agent will react to a specific condition perceived in the environment (cause) by producing an appropriate action (effect). 

However, this causal perspective is essentially equivalent to the intentional perspective (which Dennett [1989] calls the intentional stance), because irreversible actions eventually lead to a so- called “attractor” of the agent’s dynamics, and an attractor behaves indistinguishably from a goal or intention.
