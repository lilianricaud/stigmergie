# positive feedback cycle  

Like stigmergic organization in insects (Bonabeau et al., 1999), the open source development  process is self-reinforcing or autocatalytic (Heylighen, 1999; Heylighen & Gershenson, 2003): the more high quality material is already available on the community site, the more people will be drawn to check it out, and thus the more people are available to improve it further. 

Thus, open access can profit from a positive feedback cycle that boosts successful projects. This explains the explosive growth of systems such as Wikipedia or Linux. (A possible disadvantage of such “rich get richer” dynamics is that equally valuable, competing projects, because of random fluctuations or sequence effects, may fail to get the critical mass necessary to “take off”.)
