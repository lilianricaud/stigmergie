# Actor-network theory
Actor-network theory (Latour 2005) provides in many respects a broad frame for one of
the central themes of this thesis—the interplay between the agent (dubbed ‘actors’ in
this framework) and its environment. This theory simultaneously poses an ontology and
epistemology of sorts by describing how agency emerges from a larger undifferentiated
network comprising both the environment and agents in totality.

According to actor-network theory, **agency is an effect of patterned networks of interacting, heterogeneous materials including all objects and ‘objects-and-people’ networks that mediate
interaction** (Law 1992:381).

This view of agents (who are sub-networks themselves) merely as ‘punctuations’ of
heterogeneous materials therefore does not presume primacy of the agent over or in relation to the environment. Rather, it sees them as ultimately equivalent (Law 1992:383). This is because the perception and definition of the nature of an agent and the meaning associated with it, is contingent upon and generated from the intricate web of relations manifesting in the moment and not some a priori assumption.
