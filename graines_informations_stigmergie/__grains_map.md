Traditionnal collaboration relies on SOCIAL NEGOCIATION. 

Economics assumes that individuals competing in a market will start to formally cooperate, thus forming an organization or firm, in order to reduce TRANSACTION COSTS. 

A firm is based on a set of agreed-upon rules governing the interactions between its employees, so as to minimize negotiations (SOCIAL NEGOCIATION) and uncertainties. This requires drawing a clear boundary between those who belong to the organization (and therefore are expected to obey the rules) and those who do not.

In that way, the mediator coordinates further activity, directing it towards the tasks where it is most likely to be fruitful. This requires a SHARED WORKSPACE accessible to all contributors
