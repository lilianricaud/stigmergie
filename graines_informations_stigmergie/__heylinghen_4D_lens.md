The paper will start with a short review of these concepts, contrasting them with the older, Newtonian paradigm. I will then elaborate these concepts to provide an integrated foundation for a theory of self-organization, to be understood as a non-linear process of spontaneous coordination between actions. Such coordination will be shown to consist of the following components: 
- alignment, 
- division of labor, 
- workflow and 
- aggregation. 
I will then review some paradigmatic simulations and experiments that illustrate the alignment of references and communicative conventions between communicating agents. Finally, the paper will summarize the preliminary results of a series of experiments that I devised in order to observe the emergence of collective intelligence within a communicating group, and interpret
these observations in terms of alignment, division of labor and workflow.
