H. Van Dyke Parunak’s Expert Assessment of Human-Human Stigmergy (2005),
commissioned by Defense Research and Development Canada, a branch of the
Canadian Department of National Defence, stands as an excellent and far-reaching
evaluation of the mechanisms of stigmergy and its relevance to a diverse range of
human activities and potential applications. Parunak designates a number of
computational applications as stigmergic, most of which O’Reilly considers flagships of
Web 2.0. In fact, not only does he recognise Google’s PageRank system, eBay’s online
auctioning and Amazon’s recommender systems as stigmergic systems, but the entire
Internet itself.

In identifying projects such as the Open Source Software movement, Wikipedia and
others as open access, Heylighen utilises stigmergy to explain how this activity can
successfully contravene business and economic theory in regard to propriety models
where there is an apparent lack of incentive and structures for the coordination of
activity. Heylighen takes the application of stigmergy even further in a later publication,
Accelerating Socio-Technological Evolution: From Ephemeralization and Stigmergy to
the Global Brain (2007b). In this work he provides explicit connections between
stigmergy and the workings of the brain and shows how stigmergy can play a role in the
development of the ‘semantic web’ (increasingly referred to as Web 3.0) by tracing the
preferences users ‘leave on the paths they have travelled’ (2007b:16).
