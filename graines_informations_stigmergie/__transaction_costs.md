# Transaction costs

Institutional economics adds a qualification to the power of market mechanisms, though. **Its main assumption is that individuals competing in a market will start to formally cooperate, thus forming an organization or firm, in order to reduce transaction costs** (Williamson & Maste, 1995).

**Transaction costs arise because of the need to negotiate and arrange any exchange of goods, services or money.** These negotiations cost a lot of effort and time, while failing to fully eliminate basic uncertainties (is this product or service reliable? are there loopholes in the contract?). 

A firm is based on a set of agreed-upon rules governing the interactions between its employees, so as to minimize negotiations and uncertainties. This requires drawing a clear boundary between those who belong to the organization (and therefore are expected to obey the rules) and those who do not. That also helps to ensure that no private information is leaked out of the group, where it could be exploited by competitors. Whereas regulations may be more reliable than a free market, they are less flexible: they cannot adapt automatically to new circumstances. Therefore, the organization requires a form of intelligent management to coordinate the activities of the employees, and direct them to the most important task at hand. This is normally achieved by means of a hierarchical structure, with a CEO or board of directors at the top, to plan and control the activity and issue commands down the line to the lower levels. This control system moreover must ensure that the employees play according to the rules, and do not selfishly exploit the opportunities without giving their due effort in return. In other words, the management must thwart the ever-present danger of “free riders” by implementing effective punishment when necessary.
