# Patterns of scarcity mindset

The failure of Big Government, Big Business, and Big Tech is connected to the same underlying issue: when they are operated with a mindset of disconnect and ego-system awareness (competition and empire-building) rather than a mindset of interconnectivity and eco-system awareness, then you end up with a government that takes six weeks to respond to a pandemic, rather than three days; you end up with a medical equipment provider that puts profits ahead of public health; you end up with Big Data companies that put profits and the power to manipulate collective behavior ahead of empowering societies and citizens to democratize the use of their own data. Three forms of institutional failure. One root issue.

(...)

In times of business-as-usual, we tend to “outsource” the coordination of our systems to external mechanisms, such as the *visible hand* of government regulation or the *invisible hand* of the market. In times of disruption, however, these mechanisms tend to break down.


How one responds to disruption — by freezing and *turning away* or by opening and *turning toward* — is both a personal choice and a collective one.

 In “normal” times, you can get away with a lot of nonsense because for some it’s less consequential and sometimes even a bit entertaining. But in times of disruption, the very same behaviors (denial, desensing, absencing, blaming, destroying) come together as a powerful engine of accelerated self-destruction. 

 My general point is about the underlying mindset, which is one of *avoiding* reality — that is, science and data — rather than *embracing* it when the going gets tough. Clearly, this mindset is on a massive collision course with reality as we speak.

- **Denial**: 
- **Desensing**
- **Absencing**
- **Blaming others**
- **Destroying**

All these behaviors add up to a pattern of decision-making that moves us towards accelerated self-destruction. The more this becomes visible, the more likely this old model will hit a wall, and the more possible it will be for a new pattern of social collaboration to emerge. 


The key (...) is to stop downloading — that is, to stop reacting with habitual patterns of thought. That’s the first part of waking up.

The second part of waking up deals with what’s next. When you stop downloading, you realize that you actually have a choice — a choice in how you respond to any situation. You can respond by turning *away*, or by turning *toward*. Turning away means closing your mind, heart, and will — in other words, acting from *ignorance*, *hate*, and *fear*. Turning toward means opening your mind, heart, and will — acting from *curiosity*, *compassion*, and *courage*. These are the choices we face in any moment: Do we turn away and close down, or do we turn toward and open up, activating the deeper levels of our humanity?

Summing up: The first step in confronting any disruption is to stop downloading and wake up. The second step is to realize that we have a choice: we can close down, or we can open up. And the third is to embody and activate such a choice both individually and collectively.
