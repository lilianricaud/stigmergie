# EVOLUTIONNARY POTENTIAL

when you understand the power of system self-organization, you begin to understand why biologist worship biodiversity even more than econonomiste worship technology. 

The wildly varied stock of DNA, evolved and accumulated over billions of years, is the source of EVOLUTIONNARY POTENTIAL, just as science libraries and labs and universities where scientists are trained are the source of technological potential. 

Allowing species to go exctinct is a systems crime, just as ramdomly eliminating all copies of a particular science journals or particular kinds of scientists would be. that could be said of human cultures, of course, which are the store of behavioral repertoires, accumulated over not billions, but hundreds of thousands of years.
