# stigmergie qualitative et quantitative

: Quantitative stigmergy (Theraulaz & Bonabeau, 1999) refers to perceived conditions that differ in strength or degree, and where stronger traces typically elicit more forceful (intense, frequent, ...) actions. "the stronger the trace, the larger the probability of a certain action given that trace."


The two paradigmatic cases of stigmergy, termite nest-building
and ant trail-laying, follow this quantitative logic. The higher the emerging heap of mud
(stronger trace), the more an individual termite is attracted to it, and therefore the larger
the probability or frequency of mud being added. The stronger the scent of pheromone on
a trail, the less likely an ant is to deviate from that trail, and therefore the higher the
probability that it too will reinforce the trail with additional pheromone. These are typical
examples of the positive feedback that efficiently amplifies positive developments.
But quantitative stigmergy can also be exemplified by negative feedback, where a
stronger trace leads to less activity. A human example can be found in the market
mechanism. Extensive buying of a good (action) reduces the supply and thus increases
the price, which is a quantitative trace left by the collective buying and selling activity. A
higher price will normally reduce the probability that someone would buy additional
stock of that good (negative stimulation). Thus, a higher price reduces demand, which in
turn will reduce the price. This mechanism of self-organizing, distributed control
(Heylighen, 1997) implements the “invisible hand” of the market. It stabilizes prices and
efficiently allocates production capacity to the goods that are most in demand (Witt,
2006).

Qualitative stigmergy (Theraulaz & Bonabeau, 1999) refers to conditions and actions that differ in kind rather than in degree. In this case, a different trace stimulates a different type of action. An example can be found in the different stages of the building
of a funnel-shaped nest by the solitary wasp that we discussed, where each stage requires
a particular type of building action. A human example can be found in “wiki” websites
that are edited by their own readers. A paragraph that contains a semantic mistake (e.g. in
the definition of a word) will elicit a corrective action (e.g. writing a new definition).
Different types of errors, vagueness, or lack of information will stimulate different types
of additions and corrections.
In practice, there is no clear boundary between quantitative and qualitative cases
of stigmergy.
