# stigmergie qualitative et quantitative

: Quantitative stigmergy (Theraulaz & Bonabeau, 1999) refers to perceived conditions that differ in strength or degree, and where stronger traces typically elicit more forceful (intense, frequent, ...) actions. "the stronger the trace, the
larger the probability of a certain action given that trace." Qualitative stigmergy (Theraulaz & Bonabeau, 1999) refers to conditions and actions that differ in kind rather than in degree. In this case, a different trace stimulates a different type of action. An example can be found in the different stages of the building
of a funnel-shaped nest by the solitary wasp that we discussed, where each stage requires
a particular type of building action. A human example can be found in “wiki” websites
that are edited by their own readers. A paragraph that contains a semantic mistake (e.g. in
the definition of a word) will elicit a corrective action (e.g. writing a new definition).
Different types of errors, vagueness, or lack of information will stimulate different types
of additions and corrections.
In practice, there is no clear boundary between quantitative and qualitative cases
of stigmergy.
