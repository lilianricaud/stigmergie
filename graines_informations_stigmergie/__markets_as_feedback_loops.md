# Markets as feedback loops  

According to theory, the major advantage of a free market economy over a plan-based economy is coordination: a centralized planning institute can never collect and process all the information needed to decide what to produce when and where; a free market, on the other hand, functions like an “invisible hand”, that automatically allocates the right amount of resources to the production of each commodity that is needed (Hayek, 1945). This happens through the law of supply and demand and the price mechanism: whenever demand for a good exceeds supply, its price will increase, thus enticing suppliers to produce more of that good. In that way, demand and supply are automatically balanced by a negative feedback control mechanism, without need for complicated planning.
