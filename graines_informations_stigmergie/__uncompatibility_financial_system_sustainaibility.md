# prevailing financial system is incompatible with sustainability

I now understand, as proven clearly in this text, that the prevailing financial system is incompatible with sustainability in five ways:
- it causes boom and bust cycles in the economy,
- it produces short-term thinking,
- it requires unending growth,
- it concentrates wealth, and
- it destroys social capital.

Any one of these is probably enough to derail the most carefully considered plan for a transition to sustainability. Together they are a prescription for disaster, which is precisely what they are giving us. The instability of the financial system should be enough to cause alarm, as the authors point out:
“According to the IMF, between 1970 and 2010 there were 145 banking crises, 208 monetary crashes and 72 sovereign-debt crises-in other words, a staggering total of 425 systemic crises. An average of more than 10 per year! These crises have hit more than three-quarters of the 180 countries that are members of the IMF, many of them being hit several times. “

**How Money affects Sustainability**
Monetary or financial crises can be highly destructive and are obviously not compatible with sustainability. More difficult to perceive is how some mechanisms built into our current monetary system - when it is not in crisis – shape individual and collective behaviours. Among the positive effects, Modern money should be credited with triggering an explosion of entrepreneurial and scientific innovation without historical precedent. However, there are also five other mechanisms that turn out to be directly incompatible with sustainability. They are respectively:
    • **Amplification of boom and bust cycles:** Banks provide or withhold funding to the same sectors or countries at the same time, thus amplifying the business cycle towards boom or bust. Such amplification is detrimental for everyone, including the banking sector itself. In the worst-case scenario, we end up where we are now:  when banks stop trusting each other.
    • **Short-term thinking:** “Discounted cash flow” is standard practice in any investment evaluation. Because bank-debt money carries interest, the discounting of all future costs or incomes inevitably tends to lead to short-term thinking. 
    • **Compulsory growth:** The process of compound interest or interest on interest imposes exponential growth on the economy. Yet exponential growth is, by definition, unsustainable in a finite world.
    • **Concentration of wealth:** The middle class is disappearing worldwide, with most of the wealth flowing to the top and increasing rates of poverty at the bottom. Such inequalities generate a broad range of social problems and are also detrimental to economic growth. Beyond the economic issue, the very survival of democracy may be at stake.
    • **Devaluation of social capital:** Social capital such as mutual trust and collaborative action has historically been difficult to measure. Nevertheless, whenever measurements have been made, they reveal a tendency for social capital to be eroded, particularly in industrialized countries. Recent scientific studies show that money tends to promote selfish and non-collaborative behaviours. These behaviours are not compatible with long-term sustainability.

Far from being a behaviourally neutral and passive medium of exchange as generally assumed, conventional money deeply shapes a range of behaviour patterns, the five of which listed above are incompatible with sustainability. The continual imposition of a monopoly of this type of currency thus directly affects the future of humanity on our planet.
