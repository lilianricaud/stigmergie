# Influence of architectures on cooperation

Architecture, when understood in the broadest sense, refers to structured spaces in which we evolve individually and collectively. These spaces can be easily accessible to our senses (building architecture, space occupation), or partially perceived (language, money, social conventions, time...). In the first case we will refer to visible architectures, in the second case we will refer to invisible architectures.
These architectures are so present and pervasive that people are usually not aware of them and take them as the external reality that has always, and will always, shape the world.
We demonstrate that architecture plays a central role in collective intelligence, wisdom and consciousness (CIWC). Similar architectures will trigger similar collective outcomes no matter what topics, issues, market places and players are in its center. Different architecture may empower or diminish the capability of a community to deal with these given topics, issues, market places, players. Architectures not only influence our capabilities, but they create new reality.
