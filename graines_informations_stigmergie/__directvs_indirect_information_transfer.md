# Indirect vs direct information transfer


## Indirect information transfer
Indirect communication between individuals (also called stigmergic communication) is a frequent property of biological systems with many interacting agents. It refers to interactions that are mediated by the environment, based on the ability of individuals to modify their environment and to respond to such changes in specific ways.

## Direct Information Transfer

Information transfer can also occur through direct interactions. In this case, no modification of the environment (either real or virtual) is needed.
Individuals rather behave according to the actions of their neighbors. For this reason, direct interactions are usually quite limited in their range (...). The information exchanged can be of different kinds, ranging from visual signals to acoustic ones, or physical contacts. This kind of interaction is at the origin of various spatio-temporal coordinated behaviors. (ex dynamic of coordinated movements in fish schools, the emergence of temporal coordination in a clapping audience, emergence of spatial coordination such as the formation of lanes observed in some species of ants as well as pedestrians).

## Comparison of direct vs indirect information transfer

Throughout this paper, we differentiate direct and indirect information transfer. 

**In the accomplishment of consensus, sorting and optimization tasks, both kinds of communication can be used**. 

This implies questions regarding the specificities of the two communication methods in the execution of the different tasks. The examples of news sorting at digg.com, path selection in ants and trail formation in pedestrians illustrate the usage of indirect information transfer in the achievement of the different kinds of tasks. 

**The prime specificity of indirect communication is that the collective solution to a given problem is mediated via the environment.** Diggs popularity distribution, pedestrian trails and pheromone paths remain in the environment, sometimes even after the activity has ceased. Therefore, **solutions emerging from indirect interactions are characterized by a high level of robustness to external perturbations. However, robustness to changes also implies lower flexibility**. This shortcoming can be illustrated by the fact that, once an ant colony has selected a food source and built a trail toward it, it usually does not redirect its activity towards a better food source that appears at a later time, and stays stuck in a suboptimal solution (Pasteels et al., 1987). In such a way, indirect communication turns out to be particularly well adapted to stable environments with relatively persistent sources of information. For example, human trails are often strongly imprinted on the ground, which is suitable to shape urban green spaces, since entry and exit points barely evolve in time. (p90-91). In contrast, direct information transfer tends to provide a higher reactivity to external changes and appears more adapted to volatile information sources. The consensus on the swimming direction adopted by fish schools is likely to suddenly change in response to the occurrence of novel information, such as a predator strike. Here, **unlike indirect communication, information spreads directly from one individual to its neighbors, and the spatial proximity of the individuals allows the information to travel rapidly among them. In pedestrians, direct interactions allow people to optimize their movements in many regards, and lead to adapted collective answers to environmental perturbations such as obstacles or bottlenecks (Helbing et al., 2005). On the other hand, this higher flexibility often implies a lower level of selection of information, since weak random fluctuations can be amplified at the group level**. In fish schools, for example, this may create useless movements that can be costly (Couzin, 2007). In general, the higher the interaction range, the less sensitive is the system to small perturbations, since information is locally integrated among a larger number of individuals.
