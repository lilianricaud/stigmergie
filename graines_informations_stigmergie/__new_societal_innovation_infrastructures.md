# New types of societal innovation infrastructures 

How can we nourish and strengthen the manifold seed initiatives that are part of the cycle of presencing? To nourish these seeds, I believe we need to create three new types of societal innovation infrastructures.


· **New Learning Infrastructures** that link head, heart, and hand (whole-person learning). Examples include action learning and whole-person learning initiatives both in institutions of education and outside of them such as [u.lab](<https://www.presencing.org/societal-transformation-lab>) or the School For Transformation that we seek to prototype with the GAIA journey.

· **New Democratic Infrastructures** that make our governance processes more direct, more distributed, more diverse, and more dialogic. Examples here include [citizens’ assemblies on climate action (in some cases combined with a referendum](<https://medium.com/presencing-institute-blog/global-climate-action-ii-the-power-of-direct-democracy-df71d33868ea>) on the proposed results) as it is already beginning to happen in an increasing number of countries, including France, Scotland, England, Spain, and Germany.

· **New Economic Infrastructures** that shift the main focus of economic activity from ego-system awareness to eco-system awareness — from me to we. Examples here include the various [“acupuncture points” for transforming capitalism](<https://www.huffpost.com/entry/transforming-capitalism-seven-acupuncture-points_b_58e006cce4b03c2b30f6a6fa?guccounter=1>) in ways that relink the coordination and governance of economic activity back with human awareness and human intention at all levels of scale (see the evolution of governance depicted in figure 4 below).
