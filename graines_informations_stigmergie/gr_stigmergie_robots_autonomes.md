# Stigmergie Robots autonomes

## Histoire

Stigmergy was applied not only to software agents, but to their hardware
analogues: autonomous robots. Groups of very primitive robots proved able to tackle
non-trivial tasks, such as clustering items in different groupings, in a way similar to ants
(Beckers, Holland, & Deneubourg, 1994; Deneubourg et al., 1991; O. Holland & Melhuish, 1999). These robotic implementations inspired the application of stigmergic
models to problems of coordination and control in manufacturing (Valckenaers, Van
Brussel, Kollingbaum, & Bochmann, 2006).
