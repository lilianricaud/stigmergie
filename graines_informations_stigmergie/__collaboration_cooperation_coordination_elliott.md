# Coordination, Cooperation & Collaboration - a generalised framework for collective activity

In summary, contrasting the terms coordination, cooperation and collaboration provides
a great deal of insight into the processes and relationships regarding collective activity.

**Coordination** (which is not dependent upon either convergent or divergent problem solving) provides synergistic potential through the harmonisation of proximal relationships, thereby forming the sufficient conditions for cooperation and all other forms of collective activity. 

**Cooperation** on the other hand relies upon procedural compliance in a shared pursuit (enabled by the synergy of coordination), which in turn provides the collective convergent production mechanisms necessary for ‘well formed’ contributions to a collaborative venture.

**Collaboration** transcends and includes cooperation in its reliance upon procedural compliance and is distinguished from the ‘shared pursuit’ of cooperation by the inclusion of collective creation (and thus divergent production). Similarly, cooperation transcends and includes coordination in its reliance upon synergy, and as a result, coordination is also nested within collaboration, enabling the synergistic output of collectively created, emergent, shared representations. These representations differ
qualitatively and quantitatively from those produced by individuals working creatively alone through the emergence of a new whole comprising the synergistic interrelations of the individual contributions.

**Communication** Of such enabling mechanisms, perhaps the most crucial is communication— collaboration cannot be a solo venture. In the context of the present work, I will define communication as, the explicit and implicit exchange and propagation of various types of information which forms and informs the co-creation of emergent shared representations and their material externalisations.

**Discursive collaboration** is the collective divergent production of internal representations (ideas) through the exclusive use of mediated or unmediated turn-taking conversation, which consequently forms the sole collaborative output.

**Stigmergic collaboration** utilises external media as a feedback mechanism in cuing and coordinating further creative contributions which are linked to and representative of shared internal representations. Figure 2.6 shows how stigmergic collaboration emerges as an externalisation of otherwise internalised emergent, shared representations.
