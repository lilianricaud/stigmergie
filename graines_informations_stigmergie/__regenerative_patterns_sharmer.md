# Regenerative patterns

One, you cannot solve “4.0 challenges” with response mechanisms that are rooted in operating systems 2.0 and 3.0. But that of course is precisely what happens in most systems most of the time. Two, if you try to move your organization into the 4.0 realm of operating, you realize that no one can do it alone. You need an entire eco-system of partners. And three, the C19 situation has greatly accelerated the urgency of the 4.0 agenda:

· **Learning**: The spaces for deep learning have never been more in demand.

· **Health**: Strengthening the sources of health for people and planet is precisely what the current situation calls for.

· **Food and Agriculture**: food as the medium for healing the planet and its people. That’s the idea of regenerative agriculture, which has been boosted by local community-supported agriculture (CSA) related farms.

· **Corporate Sustainability**: Mission-driven enterprises are what everyone is looking for — but they are still a small and ‘endangered’ species.

· **Finance**: Regenerative, blended finance that provides resources for evolving and transforming the system. The entire financial sector seems to be at a profound inflection point, moving from impact-blind to impact-aware modes of operating.

· **Awareness-based collective action** is the seed for a new, awareness-based form of coordination and governance that is already taking root in many places.

The key to transforming our civilization, I believe, lies in our capacity to plant and cultivate these fields for co-creative action that arises from shared awareness. It’s these seeds that will activate the dormant superpowers of an emerging movement.

Once these generative social fields begin to grow, they will develop organically on their own, and if luck is on our side they will function as a “landing strip” for additional concrete possibilities that are seeking to emerge.

(...)

These are the *fields of the future* that we need to cultivate.
