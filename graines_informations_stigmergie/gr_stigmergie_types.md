# Types de stigmergie

Plusieurs systèmes de catégorisation de stigmergie ont été développés par des chercheurs:
Holland and Melhuish [1999] ont définis deux sous-types:
- active: les actions affectent les perceptions sensorielles des autres
- passive: les actions affectent le résultat des autres actions



Elliot:
Perhaps some of the more interesting research done with regards to stigmergic collaboration that is highlighted in the poster is the various categorisations thus far developed in research:

Holland and Melhuish [1999] define two subtypes:
- Active: actions affect sensory inputs of others
- Passive: actions affect the outcome of later actions

Bonabeau, et al. [1999], distinguish:

- Qualitative: sensory inputs differ by type
- Quantitative: sensory inputs differ by degree

Wilson [1975], draw the distinction between

- Sematectonic: change in state result of task-related action
- Sign-based: (or marker-based) result of something that makes no contribution to the task

As the authors of the poster point out, Grassé's original understanding of stigmergy then becomes further defined as: Active (actions affect sensory inputs of others), Qualitative (sensory inputs differ by type) Sematectonic (change in state result of task-related action) stigmergy
