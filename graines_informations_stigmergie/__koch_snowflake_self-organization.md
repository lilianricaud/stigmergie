# koch snowflake self-organization

Discoveries suggest that just a few simple oragnizing principles can lead to wildly diverse self-organizing structures. Imagine a triangle with three equal sides. Add to the middle of each side another equilateral triangle, one third the size of the first one. Add to each of the new sides another triangle, one-third smaller. And so on. The result is called a Koch snowflake. Its edge has a tremendous lenght but it can be contained withing a circle. this structure is one simple example of fractal geometry- a realm of mathematics and art populated by elaborate shapes formed by relatively simple rules.
