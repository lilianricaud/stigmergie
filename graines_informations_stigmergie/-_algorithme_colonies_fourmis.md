One class of stigmergic mechanisms in particular, so-called ant algorithms, turned out to be surprisingly powerful in tackling a variety of computational problems, including the notorious traveling salesman problem (Dorigo, Bonabeau, & Theraulaz, 2000) and the optimization of packet routing along communication networks (Kassabalidis et al., 2001).
