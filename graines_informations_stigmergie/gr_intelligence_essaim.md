## Histoire

With the advent of the agent-based paradigm in computer simulation, insect
societies were conceptualized as swarms of simple agents that are able to perform
complex tasks using various forms of self-organization, and especially stigmergy
(Deneubourg, Theraulaz, & Beckers, 1992). The general ability to tackle complex
problems exhibited by such self-organizing multi-agent collectives became known as
swarm intelligence (Bonabeau, Dorigo, & Theraulaz, 1999; Kennedy, 2006). One class of
stigmergic mechanisms in particular, so-called ant algorithms, turned out to be
surprisingly powerful in tackling a variety of computational problems,
