# enhancing web stigmergy

To be able to fully compete with the established market-based system, moreover, the still very young open access movement will need to further learn from its experiences, addressing its remaining weaknesses and building further on its strengths. This will in particular require developing better standards and rules, and more powerful software solutions for harnessing stigmergy and allocating recognition and feedback—the main drivers behind the success of open access according to the present analysis. 

For example, in the Wikipedia system—which otherwise keeps a very detailed track of all changes made to all documents by all users—it is impossible at present to get an overview of how much a particular user has contributed to the system. 

Given Wikipedia’s versioning system, it should be possible to measure how much of the text entered by a given user survives in the present state of the encyclopedia. 

This would provide a useful measure of both the quantity and the quality of that author’s contributions, thus establishing a benchmark by which to measure expertise and activity level. 

Similarly, more advanced algorithms (e.g. inspired by Google’s PageRank or Hebbian learning, Heylighen, 1999) could be implemented to organize and prioritize tasks. 

Such intelligent methods for coordinating distributed information production could turn the World-Wide Web from merely a collective memory or shared workspace into a true “Global Brain” for humanity, that would be able to efficiently solve any problem, however complex (Heylighen, 1999, 2004).
